# The Giphinator
## Turning gifs into animated ASCII art
By [Emily Kowal](https://github.com/emottk/) and [Gabi O'Connor](https://github.com/GabiOC/)

This is a small app built to turn gifs from Giphy (as well as your own gifs) into ASCII art that runs in your terminal.
Video demo [here](https://youtu.be/pZ4QysBQkUs).
